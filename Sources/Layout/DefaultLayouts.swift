// The starting arrangement for each surface.
//
// These are NOT designs. Each one is a transcription of what that surface
// actually draws today, expressed in the grid, so that a user opening the
// editor for the first time sees the player they already had and edits from
// there. Where a surface has no equivalent of a grid element, the note on the
// placement says so.
//
// Derived by reading, in order:
//   desktop     Sources/Vinyl/VinylWidgetView.swift + VinylWidgetWindowManager.swift
//   lockWidget  Anchor's Components/LockScreen/LockScreenMusicPanel.swift, collapsed state
//   lockFull    Anchor's Components/LockScreen/LockScreenImmersivePlayer.swift
//   launcher    Anchor's Components/Launcher/LauncherWidgets.swift
//
// Placement ids are deterministic rather than random. A fresh `UUID()` per
// launch would make every default layout a different value, so `Defaults`
// would see a change and write on every start, and two machines syncing the
// same settings would fight. Seeded ids also mean a test can name a placement.
